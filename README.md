# üé¨ Sentiment2GAN ‚Äî Sentiment Analysis (IMDB) + DCGAN on MedMNIST

This project brings together **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Generative Modeling (GANs)** to demonstrate how Deep Learning can be applied across very different domains ‚Äî text (sentiment analysis) and medical imaging (synthetic generation).  
Developed as part of **Deep Learning coursework (DATA 255 @ SJSU)**, it highlights my ability to build **end-to-end pipelines, compare architectures, and evaluate models with both qualitative and quantitative metrics**.

## üîë Project Highlights
### Part 1 ‚Äî IMDB Sentiment Analysis
- **Dataset:** IMDB Movie Reviews (50k reviews)  
- **Text Preprocessing:** tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal, HTML stripping, lemmatization/stemming.  
- **Word Embeddings:** Word2Vec for feature representation.  
- **Architectures compared:**
  - RNN  
  - LSTM  
  - GRU  
  - BiLSTM  
- **Training setup:** 50+ iterations with early stopping, train/val/test split.  
- **Results:** BiLSTM achieved the highest accuracy, demonstrating strong sequential context capture.

### Part 2 ‚Äî DCGAN on MedMNIST
- **Dataset:** MedMNIST (PathMNIST / BloodMNIST etc.)  
- **Generator architecture:** deconvolution-based, trained for ‚â•1000 epochs.  
- **Discriminator:** 3+ convolutional layers with BatchNorm + LeakyReLU.  
- **Evaluation:**
  - Generator & Discriminator loss curves for training dynamics.  
  - **FID Score** (1000 real vs 1000 generated samples) for quantitative evaluation.  
  - Mode collapse detection using both loss curves and generated samples.  
- **Results:** Generated 32+ synthetic medical images; evaluated quality vs mode collapse risk.

## üìä Key Results
- **Sentiment Analysis:**  
  - RNN/GRU performed well but LSTM and BiLSTM achieved **best accuracy and generalization**.  
- **DCGAN:**  
  - Generated realistic MedMNIST images after 1000 epochs.  
  - **FID scores confirmed diversity**, though occasional mode collapse was observed.  
  - Static evaluation of samples showed reasonable class variability.
